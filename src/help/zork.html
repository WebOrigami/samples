<p>
  In Zork, the player explores the abandoned Great Underground Empire in search
  of treasure. The player moves between the game's hundreds of locations and
  interacts with objects by typing commands in natural language that the game
  interprets. The program acts as a narrator, describing the player's location
  and the results of the player's commands. It has been described as the most
  famous piece of interactive fiction.
